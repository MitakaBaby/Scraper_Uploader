# Scraper_Uploader

This is a module that I have created to help myself manage all of the affiliate networks I work with.

You have to configure all of the jsons except the scheduler_data.json in the "jsons" folder so this can start scraping and uploading.

You have to add credentials in common.py class Credentials file. 

There are few more things that you have to configure in the distribution.py, uploading.py and main.py files.

But in the end start main.py and let it sink. It will scrape, upload and repeat.

Currently for myself it's configured to scrape around 800 sites at specific times and days, generate posts that have to be uploaded in my site, uploads them and many other things that are not in the module. That cuts my affiliate marketing work with many hours daily. I don't think I can manage to handle manually 110 affiliate networks.

This is the standby phase of the module.

This is the active phase when scraping sites.

You need to have strong internet connection for this to work.
